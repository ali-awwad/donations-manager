  <p>

      Donation Admin Panel is a management tool to help you track the donations and which categories they are going to.
  </p>

<p>
  Donation Admin Panel is very helpful when you have a group of individuals having a few common causes that you want to help with, yet you want to donate wisely to specific sectors.
</p>

<p>
  As an example, usually a group of people would like to donate to certain areas, such as Health, Education, and Housing. You can create these three categories in the admin panel, then assign to each categories more specific campaigns. Like you and your friends decide to start a campaign of helping 100 student to pay their university loans for 2023, and another campaign for the next year as well.
</p>

<p>
  This gives you the insights where your money are going to and how much you and your colleagues have provided in each category.
