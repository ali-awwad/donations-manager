<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The TCT Communication Mission Planning System takes the guesswork out of tactical communication deployment and enables the user to plan networks in both time and space.&#38;nbsp;The system can be used stand alone or together with CAPAS&#38;trade; alignment systems for unprecedented speed and ease of deployment. By keeping track of the equipment located with each unit, TCT helps a planner quickly identify possible links based on the available equipment and perform radio propagation analysis based on available terrain data. For non-directional links the system can quickly calculate radio coverage for an arbitrary shaped area, useful for typical VHF Combat Radio Networks. Upon deployment network data can be digitally disseminated to the tactical communication nodes, where the CAPAS&#38;trade; alignment systems accurately direct the antennas for optimal performance &#38;mdash; in a matter of seconds! </p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The VULCANO Guided Ammunition Family&#38;nbsp;was developed under a German-Italian&#38;nbsp;government agreement by cooperation of&#38;nbsp;the companies Diehl Defence and&#38;nbsp;Leonardo Electronics &#38;ndash; Defence Systems.&#60;br&#62;This new guided ammunition family,&#38;nbsp;comprising the 127 mm type for navies as&#38;nbsp;well as the 155 mm variant for army&#38;nbsp;artillery, is bound to revolutionize the&#60;br&#62;artillery&#38;acute;s and navy&#38;acute;s indirect fire.&#38;nbsp;The combination of IMU-GPS navigation&#38;nbsp;with the possibility of Terminal Homing&#38;nbsp;based on Semi-Active Laser (SAL) or&#60;br&#62;Far-Infrared (FarIR) sensors enables the&#38;nbsp;VULCANO ammunition to engage even&#38;nbsp;small stationary and moving targets with&#38;nbsp;direct hits at extended ranges.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: bold;">IRIS-T Infra Red Imaging System &ndash; Tail/Thrust Vector Controlled</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The IRIS-T guided missile was developed as aircraft armament for air combat.
The combination of thrust vector and aerodynamic control provides the missile with extremely high agility. The imaging IR seeker head in conjunction with intelligent image processing is another technological leap. The target can be designated by the airborne radar or via the pilot's helmet sight. The outstanding features of IRIS-T even enable the engagement of targets behind the aircraft as well as interception of enemy missiles.
In addition to the consortium partners Germany (pilot nation), Greece, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Spain, further countries worldwide have decided to procure IRIS-T. It was selected as standard weapon for the Eurofighter, F5, F-16, EF-18, Tornado and Gripen fighter aircraft.
Besides its role as aircraft armament, IRIS-T is now also used as surface-to-air missile, e.g. in the ground-based air defence system IRIS-T SLS for object and short-range protection. Furthermore, the Norwegian Air Force demonstrated for the first time in a firing trial in 2016 that IRIS-T is also able to engage sea targets.
Diehl Defence is prime contractor in the IRIS-T program, producing the missile since 2005 in cooperation with industrial partners from six European program nations.
A performance upgrade of the IRIS-T missile to a block II version is currently being prepared by the IRIS-T consortium under the leadership of Germany.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: bold;">Ziesel</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Ziesel is an unmanned, all-electric tracked infantry support platform. With a weight of approx. 300 kg and the dimensions (L x W x H) 1.3 m x 1.3 m x 0.7&#38;nbsp;m, it achieves a speed of approx. 20 km/h. It overcomes slopes of 60 % with a torque of 1000 Nm. The platform has a range of 40&#38;nbsp;km with one battery charge. The battery (charging capacity = 9.7kWh) can be removed and quickly exchanged.
The Ziesel is to be regarded as a soldier support platform. Accordingly, the focus of the functions is on relieving the soldier. Heavy, health-endangering, exhausting and dangerous activities are to be taken over by the Ziesel. This should enable the soldier to be ready for action for longer and to concentrate more on the prevailing situation. In addition to relieving the soldier, the Ziesel also serves to gather information and can thus additionally support the soldier's safety.
The Ziesel is currently the smallest infantry support platform. Due to its very high payload, which far exceeds its own weight, it can, however, meet all the requirements formulated so far by the armies and is thus in no way inferior to its competitors. The small design makes it manoeuvrable and precisely controllable, which means that the Ziesel follows the soldier without any problems even in very dense vegetation in the forest. Since the width of the platform only slightly exceeds that of the soldier, only a few smaller trees are run over when driving through the forest. This leads to an almost silent following and to a much more difficult reconnaissance by the enemy. Furthermore, this characteristic allows the Ziesel to move much faster in the forest.
Following unmanned capabilities are provided by the integrated PLATON Autonomy Kit from Diehl Defence.
&#38;bull;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; Teleoperation: The operator directly controls the UGV using a joystick. He can control the UGV under LOS and NLOS conditions. Usually a wireless communication is required to send commands to the UGV and to receive status feedback. For NLOS additionally the video-stream of one or more cameras must be streamed via communication network. Both, commands and video must be transmitted with low latency (ideally in real time). Communication range is usually 1-3 km depending on the radios and environment. Under LOS conditions, the UGV may also be controlled using gesture control. In this case, no radio communication is required.
&#38;bull;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; Convoy/Follow Me: &#60;br&#62;For smaller UGVs following a soldier, tracking can be done with cameras only. The following mode does not require active sensors or GNSS. This makes the UGV difficult for the enemy to detect and robust against electronic warfare assets.
&#38;bull;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; MULE/Patrolling: In this mode the UGVs follows a recorded route. The route can be recorded in teleoperation mode or follow me mode. The record consists of GPS data and optionally digital 3D map data derived from LiDAR and Radar data. Live data from LiDAR and Radar enables the UGV to detect and avoid obstacles during the MULE mission.
&#38;bull;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; Waypoint Navigation: The operator selects one or several waypoints. The mission planning algorithm generates a path based on these waypoints. If available, also street map data can be included in the planning.</p>

Additionally, in self-protection, it is capable of intercepting approaching anti-radar missiles. The high degree of automation enables the system to be operated with minimal manpower and allows rapid tactical deployments with short set-up and dismantling times. &#60;br&#62;The use of standardized interfaces provides the optimum basis for future upgrades or expansions. Whether it is a matter of reconfiguration or modernization of existing air defence systems, Diehl Defence finds suitable solutions for its customers&#38;rsquo; needs. This has already been proven in projects for international customers and in numerous test firings with different radars and command and control systems.
&#38;nbsp;
IRIS-T SLS
&#60;br&#62;Using the IRIS-T air-to-air guided missile in the surface-to-air version represents an effective and cost favourable solution for the implementation of a short and very-short range air defence system. For this purpose, an adapted software is installed automatically on the IRIS-T guided missile when loaded onto the launcher. By this approach, the use of missiles already procured and introduced into service can be significantly expanded. In some Northern European countries, IRIS-T SLS versions for mobile and stationary deployment are already under contract.&#60;br&#62;With an effective range of up to 12 km and a height coverage of 6 km, IRIS-T SLS provides full 360&#38;deg; protection for high-value objects and point defence against a broad threat catalogue. In addition, IRIS-T SLS offers the possibility to combine all components (launcher with effector, sensor and fire control station C2) of an air defence system on only one protected carrier vehicle. This results in the third version generation of the proven system: IRIS-T SLS Mk. III. With its high basic mobility and fire-on-the-move capability, IRIS-T SLS Mk. III is capable of protecting forces on the move against all airborne threats within the shortest possible reaction times.
&#38;nbsp;
IRIS-T SLX
&#60;br&#62;Diehl Defence is tasked to develop and field its new IRIS-T SLX long-range air defence system. It brings along the most modern technology and maximum protection. With its new dual mode seeker, among others, this system provides superior protection within 80 km effective range and 30 km altitude coverage. IRIS-T SLM and IRIS-T SLX can be combined on the same launcher in the same system configuration. As well as for Diehl Defence&#38;rsquo;s other GBAD system, C2 and sensor for the long-range system can be chosen by the customers tailored to their mission and requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">BANS&#38;trade; introduces effective anti-aircraft defence without a single shot fired. The light shoulder weapon simulates a missile launch pattern that digitally stimulates an aircraft&#38;rsquo;s missile launch warning and detection system and triggers its alarm. The combat aircraft or helicopter is forced to immediately dispense countermeasures with flares. Extensive use of flares leaves the combat aircraft vulnerable to anti-aircraft missiles. Pilots must then either abort their mission or remain under VSHORAD missiles.
A New Course of Future Airstrike Missions
BANS&#38;trade; redefines the modern approach to air defence with a new philosophy and design. The BANS&#38;trade; device is battery-powered and delivers up to 500 simulated missile launch activations. It is easy to use, with no specific training needed and very cost-effective. As such, BANS&#38;trade; devices can be widely distributed throughout the battlefield with a swarm attack logic, thus significantly shifting the course of future airstrike missions.&#38;nbsp;
Contemporary Philosophy of Air Defence
BANS&#38;trade; has multiple usage varieties, but the most effective is when used in tandem with MANPADS, SHORAD or mounted on any remote weapon station or drone. This results in a significant increase in target hit probability. BANS&#38;trade; presents the revolution of VSHORAD tactical warfare.&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;</p>
