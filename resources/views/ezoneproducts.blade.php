VULCANO - Guided Ammunition Family

The VULCANO Guided Ammunition Family&nbsp;was developed under a German-Italian&nbsp;government agreement by cooperation of&nbsp;the companies Diehl Defence and&nbsp;Leonardo Electronics &ndash; Defence Systems.<br>This new guided ammunition family,&nbsp;comprising the 127 mm type for navies as&nbsp;well as the 155 mm variant for army&nbsp;artillery, is bound to revolutionize the<br>artillery&acute;s and navy&acute;s indirect fire.&nbsp;The combination of IMU-GPS navigation&nbsp;with the possibility of Terminal Homing&nbsp;based on Semi-Active Laser (SAL) or<br>Far-Infrared (FarIR) sensors enables the&nbsp;VULCANO ammunition to engage even&nbsp;small stationary and moving targets with&nbsp;direct hits at extended ranges.

IRIS-T Infra Red Imaging System – Tail/Thrust Vector Controlled

The IRIS-T guided missile was developed as aircraft armament for air combat. The combination of thrust vector and aerodynamic control provides the missile with extremely high agility. The imaging IR seeker head in conjunction with intelligent image processing is another technological leap. The target can be designated by the airborne radar or via the pilots helmet sight. The outstanding features of IRIS-T even enable the engagement of targets behind the aircraft as well as interception of enemy missiles. In addition to the consortium partners Germany (pilot nation), Greece, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Spain, further countries worldwide have decided to procure IRIS-T. It was selected as standard weapon for the Eurofighter, F5, F-16, EF-18, Tornado and Gripen fighter aircraft. Besides its role as aircraft armament, IRIS-T is now also used as surface-to-air missile, e.g. in the ground-based air defence system IRIS-T SLS for object and short-range protection. Furthermore, the Norwegian Air Force demonstrated for the first time in a firing trial in 2016 that IRIS-T is also able to engage sea targets. Diehl Defence is prime contractor in the IRIS-T program, producing the missile since 2005 in cooperation with industrial partners from six European program nations. A performance upgrade of the IRIS-T missile to a block II version is currently being prepared by the IRIS-T consortium under the leadership of Germany.

Ziesel

The Ziesel is an unmanned, all-electric tracked infantry support platform. With a weight of approx. 300 kg and the dimensions (L x W x H) 1.3 m x 1.3 m x 0.7&nbsp;m, it achieves a speed of approx. 20 km/h. It overcomes slopes of 60 % with a torque of 1000 Nm. The platform has a range of 40&nbsp;km with one battery charge. The battery (charging capacity = 9.7kWh) can be removed and quickly exchanged. The Ziesel is to be regarded as a soldier support platform. Accordingly, the focus of the functions is on relieving the soldier. Heavy, health-endangering, exhausting and dangerous activities are to be taken over by the Ziesel. This should enable the soldier to be ready for action for longer and to concentrate more on the prevailing situation. In addition to relieving the soldier, the Ziesel also serves to gather information and can thus additionally support the soldiers safety. The Ziesel is currently the smallest infantry support platform. Due to its very high payload, which far exceeds its own weight, it can, however, meet all the requirements formulated so far by the armies and is thus in no way inferior to its competitors. The small design makes it manoeuvrable and precisely controllable, which means that the Ziesel follows the soldier without any problems even in very dense vegetation in the forest. Since the width of the platform only slightly exceeds that of the soldier, only a few smaller trees are run over when driving through the forest. This leads to an almost silent following and to a much more difficult reconnaissance by the enemy. Furthermore, this characteristic allows the Ziesel to move much faster in the forest. Following unmanned capabilities are provided by the integrated PLATON Autonomy Kit from Diehl Defence. &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teleoperation: The operator directly controls the UGV using a joystick. He can control the UGV under LOS and NLOS conditions. Usually a wireless communication is required to send commands to the UGV and to receive status feedback. For NLOS additionally the video-stream of one or more cameras must be streamed via communication network. Both, commands and video must be transmitted with low latency (ideally in real time). Communication range is usually 1-3 km depending on the radios and environment. Under LOS conditions, the UGV may also be controlled using gesture control. In this case, no radio communication is required. &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Convoy/Follow Me: <br>For smaller UGVs following a soldier, tracking can be done with cameras only. The following mode does not require active sensors or GNSS. This makes the UGV difficult for the enemy to detect and robust against electronic warfare assets. &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MULE/Patrolling: In this mode the UGVs follows a recorded route. The route can be recorded in teleoperation mode or follow me mode. The record consists of GPS data and optionally digital 3D map data derived from LiDAR and Radar data. Live data from LiDAR and Radar enables the UGV to detect and avoid obstacles during the MULE mission. &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waypoint Navigation: The operator selects one or several waypoints. The mission planning algorithm generates a path based on these waypoints. If available, also street map data can be included in the planning.

EdgeRCWS

A fire control unit (FCU) embedded with AI to automate the system&rsquo;s mechanical operation and automatic target recognition, increasing NGCV lethality. With smart landscape segmentation, the system scans and identifies targets over large land areas. The FCU holds ballistic information (e.g., bullet caliber, rifle type) and calculates an ideal smart fire sequencing based on the weapon, projectile, and the target&rsquo;s context and distance, improving both accuracy and efficiency.

HPEM SkyWolf Effector

HPEM (High-Power Electro-Magnetics) effectors offer the possibility to disturb the operation of electronic systems by means of interference pulses. The non-lethal effectors can be used to protect armed forces against Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), to stop getaway vehicles in moving traffic without employing physical force and to prevent unauthorized access to critical security areas. Moreover, HPEM effectors can counter small, unmanned aerial vehicles in the vicinity. HPEM effectors pose no health hazard to users and uninvolved individuals. When it comes to the defence of drones of NATO Class 1, Diehl Defence cooperates with the industry partners ESG and Rohde &amp; Schwarz in a system network under the marketing name GUARDION. GUARDION is a modular drone defence system for which Diehl Defence particularly supplies HPEM effectors for countering drones and EO AI trackers for drone detection. In addition, Diehl Defence is the main point of contact for military customers when it comes to GUARDION.

Ground Based Air Defence Systems

&nbsp; IRIS-T SLM With its unique integration philosophy, Diehl Defence offers its customers a state-of-the-art air defence system. The possibility of integrating a variety of different sensors and effectors provides the basis for customer-specific solutions. Thanks to the flexibility in selecting different components, such as carrier vehicle or radio equipment, material already introduced into service can be used, or national industry can be involved.<br>IRIS-T SLM provides 360&deg; protection of high-value assets and areas against a broad threat catalogue. High firepower, shortest reaction time and multiple, omni-directional engagements provide superior protection within an effective range of 40 km and 20 km altitude. High-resolution seeker technology combined with superior agility enables the guided missile to intercept fast and highly manoeuvring targets. Additionally, in self-protection, it is capable of intercepting approaching anti-radar missiles. The high degree of automation enables the system to be operated with minimal manpower and allows rapid tactical deployments with short set-up and dismantling times. <br>The use of standardized interfaces provides the optimum basis for future upgrades or expansions. Whether it is a matter of reconfiguration or modernization of existing air defence systems, Diehl Defence finds suitable solutions for its customers&rsquo; needs. This has already been proven in projects for international customers and in numerous test firings with different radars and command and control systems. &nbsp; IRIS-T SLS <br>Using the IRIS-T air-to-air guided missile in the surface-to-air version represents an effective and cost favourable solution for the implementation of a short and very-short range air defence system. For this purpose, an adapted software is installed automatically on the IRIS-T guided missile when loaded onto the launcher. By this approach, the use of missiles already procured and introduced into service can be significantly expanded. In some Northern European countries, IRIS-T SLS versions for mobile and stationary deployment are already under contract.<br>With an effective range of up to 12 km and a height coverage of 6 km, IRIS-T SLS provides full 360&deg; protection for high-value objects and point defence against a broad threat catalogue. In addition, IRIS-T SLS offers the possibility to combine all components (launcher with effector, sensor and fire control station C2) of an air defence system on only one protected carrier vehicle. This results in the third version generation of the proven system: IRIS-T SLS Mk. III. With its high basic mobility and fire-on-the-move capability, IRIS-T SLS Mk. III is capable of protecting forces on the move against all airborne threats within the shortest possible reaction times. &nbsp; IRIS-T SLX <br>Diehl Defence is tasked to develop and field its new IRIS-T SLX long-range air defence system. It brings along the most modern technology and maximum protection. With its new dual mode seeker, among others, this system provides superior protection within 80 km effective range and 30 km altitude coverage. IRIS-T SLM and IRIS-T SLX can be combined on the same launcher in the same system configuration. As well as for Diehl Defence&rsquo;s other GBAD system, C2 and sensor for the long-range system can be chosen by the customers tailored to their mission and requirements.

BANS

BANS&trade; introduces effective anti-aircraft defence without a single shot fired. The light shoulder weapon simulates a missile launch pattern that digitally stimulates an aircraft&rsquo;s missile launch warning and detection system and triggers its alarm. The combat aircraft or helicopter is forced to immediately dispense countermeasures with flares. Extensive use of flares leaves the combat aircraft vulnerable to anti-aircraft missiles. Pilots must then either abort their mission or remain under VSHORAD missiles. A New Course of Future Airstrike Missions BANS&trade; redefines the modern approach to air defence with a new philosophy and design. The BANS&trade; device is battery-powered and delivers up to 500 simulated missile launch activations. It is easy to use, with no specific training needed and very cost-effective. As such, BANS&trade; devices can be widely distributed throughout the battlefield with a swarm attack logic, thus significantly shifting the course of future airstrike missions.&nbsp; Contemporary Philosophy of Air Defence BANS&trade; has multiple usage varieties, but the most effective is when used in tandem with MANPADS, SHORAD or mounted on any remote weapon station or drone. This results in a significant increase in target hit probability. BANS&trade; presents the revolution of VSHORAD tactical warfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;

.375 SWISS P

The new .375 SWISS P long-distance ammunition has been especially developed for the requirements of operational precision shooters. The new calibre is suitable for highly demanding situations and markedly increases the operational spectrum of the proven .338 weapons system. .375 SWISS P&nbsp;calibre projectile types can reach distances of up to 1,600 m supersonic, which equates to an increase in operational range of more than 10 percent when compared to the .338 LM. This helps you to extend the time window for infiltration and exfiltration, and with it, increase your own protection. The powerful upgrade&nbsp;for your .338 weapon system Manufacturers of typically robust .338 Lapua Mag. rifles only need to validate their system with the&nbsp;new .375 SWISS P chambered barrel. The new calibre fills the gap between .338 calibre and .50,&nbsp;providing you with a tactical advantage for the most diverse missions.<br><br>.375 SWISS P is the optimum upgrade for proven .338 weapon&nbsp;systems. No cumbersome system change is required to benefit&nbsp;from the new calibre. The majority of .338 weapons systems can&nbsp;be upgraded with only modest effort. Manufacturers can officially&nbsp;change the barrel and .375 SWISS P ammunition is fully ready to be&nbsp;deployed on your .338 weapon system. It can also be used with&nbsp;a interchangeable barrel on multi-calibre weapons systems.&nbsp;Negligible weight increase means that operational precision&nbsp;shooters can still benefit from supreme manoeuvrability:&nbsp;a significant advantage over heavy .50 weapons systems.

Fragmentation Analysis

When it comes to fragmentation test, it is impossible to use a classic 3D configuration for measuring the spatial repartition of fragments due to the high num-ber of pieces which can mask each other. TrackEye Arena offers an alternative solution where one or several screens with possibly different thick-nesses or materials are positioned at a certain distance from an exploding device and monitored by a high speed camera. The TrackEye software offers then a combination of dedicated statistics modules to characterize the flying particles impacting the screens for a qualitative un-derstanding of the fragmentation test. The 3D loca-tion, angular dispersion, time of first appearance, and shape of each of the panel holes is detected automati-cally by the TrackEye Arena algorithms. All results are presented in various diagrams including a 3D recon-struction of the fragmentation test even when using one camera only. The TrackEye ARENA solution is a world standard for fragmentation tests and is being widely used by defence research laboratories and proving grounds throughout the world.

U.S. Ordnance M249 Light Machine Gun

The M249 light machine gun (LMG), previously&nbsp;designated the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW),&nbsp;and formally written as Light Machine Gun, 5.56 mm, is an American version of the Belgian FN Minimi. The M249 is manufactured in the United States and is widely used by the U.S. Armed Forces.&nbsp;The US Ordnance M249 machine gun provides infantry squads with the heavy volume of fire of a machine gun combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle. It can be fed from both linked ammunition and STANAG magazines, like those used in the M16 and M4. This allows the SAW gunner to use rifleman&rsquo;s magazines as an emergency source of ammunition in the event that he runs out of linked rounds.&nbsp;The M249 is gas operated and air cooled. It has a&nbsp;quick-change barrel, allowing the gunner to rapidly&nbsp;replace an overheated or jammed barrel. A folding bipod is attached near the front of the gun and a M1913 rail on the top cover for mounting day &amp; night optic sights.

U.S. Ordnance MK19 Mod3

US Ordnance produces the MK19 MOD 3 40mm grenade machine gun which is air cooled, blow back operated, automatic fire, belt-fed weapon that has an angle of fire between 70 degrees elevation and 70 degrees depression. The MK19 MOD 3 is not designed to cook off because it fires from an open bolt and has a low barrel temperature during rapid fire. It is capable of firing various rounds, such as the M430A1 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) grenades 40mm grenades, at a cyclic rate of 325 to 375 rounds per minute. The MK19 MOD 3 can dominate space at short and long range distances with continuous firepower. When employed on the battlefield, it is capable of delivering lethal fire against a variety of targets, including lightly armored vehicles and dismounted infantry out in the open, in defilade, or in entrenched fighting positions. Due to its low recoil and comparatively light weight, the MK19 MOD 3 has been adapted for use on many different platforms, including small attack boats and fast attack vehicles, such as the Humvee (HMMWV), AAV and Stryker, military jeeps and a large variety of naval mounts. HEDP grenades will penetrate 75mm rolled homogenous armor at a maximum range of 2,212 meters which means it can penetrate most infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers. Dismounted personnel within a radius of 15 meters from impact will be immobilized by blast and fragmentation. The MK19 MOD 3 is especially effective when used against enemy infantry formations. Since it is highly portable within small and large units, the weapon&rsquo;s high lethality and broad versatility make it the prime choice of U.S. warfighters as an essential weapon in both offensive and defensive operations.

U.S. Ordnance M60E6

US Ordnance M2A2 Crew Served Machine Gun

The U.S. Ordnance M2A2 machine gun is an air-cooled, belt-fed machine gun that fires from a closed bolt and operates on the short recoil principle with fixed headspace and timing. It is capable of both sustained automatic and accurate single-shot fire. It can be mounted on a vehicle, boat, helicopter or other aircraft. Ammunition may be fed from either the left or right side of the gun, making it suitable for use by both infantry and in armored vehicles. The M2A2 weapon system has been tested to well over 50,000 rounds. Its single-breech lock system allows for field rebuild, eliminating the need for depot-level maintenance during its lifetime and thereby greatly reducing logistical support. U.S. Ordnance developed its M2A2 12.7mm weapon after years of experience manufacturing machine guns for the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Foreign Allies. Its M2A2 offers the proven performance of the existing M2HB machine gun but also features fixed headspace and timing. This upgrade improves the performance of the battle-proven M2HB weapon system, largely increases the safety level for operating personnel and affords barrel changing on crew-served or coaxial-mounted weapons in 10 or fewer seconds. Only one person needs to change the M2A2 barrel, thereby reducing exposure to enemy fire and quickly readying the weapon for continued operation. The U.S. Ordnance M2A2 system utilizes the standard barrel thread, which means standard M2HB barrels can be used in the A2 gun as needed, in emergencies or training. (Using the standard M2HB barrel in a QCB weapon requires removing the Barrel Support Locating Pin, then headspacing the barrel using the standard headspace and timing gage.) Using only the A2 conversion kit, an armorer at the customer location can convert an M2HB machine gun into a U.S. Ordnance M2A2 weapon system in fewer than 30 minutes, without complex tools or machines.

S4PF sampling solution for liquids & powders

Proengins S4PF solution coupled with existing AP4C technology, is the only available solution on the market with the unique ability to detect threats in both powder and liquid form.&nbsp; In the recent decades, the nature of threats has evolved (eg Novichocks, opiods, crisis). In the case of chemical warfare agents, many different types are not in the gaseous state at ambient temperatures (20&deg;c, I atm). This is particularly the case for 4th generation CWAs, making it a challenge for detection technologies.&nbsp; The S4PF scraper collects substances by friction from the polluted surface. After inserting the S4PF into the sampling pipe of the AP4C, the scrapers quickly warms up to evaporate the collected substances. The AP4C will then detect the presence of the threat in the vapours generated.&nbsp;

MARINE ASSAULT VEHICLE

The Marine Assault Vehicle (MAV)is the latest technology amphibious vehicle designed by FNSS to meet amphibious operational requirements. During the beach landing phase of an amphibious operation, these vehicles are launched from landing helicopter<br>docks (LHD) and are able to rapidly cover the distance between the vessel and the shore, allowing marine units to land under armour protection. Once on land, they are able to operate alongside other armoured vehicles. The MAV fire power<br>is provided by the purposely designed CAKA dual remote-controlled turret that can be armed with a 12.7 mm MG and a 40 mm AGL. Designed to support dual operations based on their mission requirements, armoured amphibious assault vehicles need to ensure superior capabilities both at sea and on land. A unique hull design and powerful water jets make the MAV highly mobile in the water with a speed of 7 knots, as well as on land, at 70 km/h maximum speed. The base vehicle can be configured in different variants such as Personnel Carrier and Command Post. Few navies worldwide possess such a capability. The FNSS MAV carries the armour protected amphibious fighting vehicle concept into the 21st century. Compared to similar systems, the MAV can be considered superior in the following respects: &bull; Number of transported personnel,<br>&bull; Level of ballistic and mine protection,<br>&bull; New generation remote controlled turret,<br>&bull; Performances on land and afloat.

Flashlube Catch Can

The Flashlube Catch Can Pro is a premium oil fume filter that protects the engine by filtering out damaging oil mist and condensation from the air entering the inlet passage. This oil mist and condensation often causes carbon build up resulting in loss of power, fuel economy and can consequently lead to expensive engine damage. This unit is designed with unique safety valves, to ensure its installation will not over pressurise the engine and is compact in size at 146mm high x 116mm wide x 137mm deep. Benefits include: Maintains vehicle power &amp; efficiency Reduces carbon build up in inlet manifold Stops intercooler contamination Reduces corrosion of turbo bearings Ensures cleaner air is delivered to the engine Keeps sensors clean Features include: Pressure relief valve Vacuum relief valve Replaceable filter element Large (19mm) inlet &amp; outlet ports Small size to fit in compact engine bays Rotating head to assist fitting

Flashlube pre filter

Common Rail Diesel Systems can be incredibly efficient, however they are also intolerant to water and dirt particles that can result in costly engine repair. To help protect your engine from this damage, fit a Flashlube Diesel Filter.

The Flashlube Diesel Filter is a modular diesel fuel filter/water separator system. It features a complete range of modules and components to meet any diesel filtration need. Attached to a header is a 30 Micron Pre-Filter/Water Separator Element, which contains the media to remove water &amp; other contaminants.

Air filter insert

The upper filter housing of some 4WDs features a seal surface too narrow to match the seal of the filter itself. As a result, the filter is not able to be fully effective, allowing dust to pass through the airbox and enter the engine intake, causing havoc with components. In response, Terrain Tamer designed a range of vehicle specific,&nbsp;stainless-steel filter inserts&nbsp;for the most problematic vehicle models, which, when fitted, create a surface area that perfectly matches the filter, aligning in the correct position to properly seal, and reducing the issue of dusting. This problem is particularly prevalent in 4WD&rsquo;s where gravel roads, bull dust and sand all contain damaging particles, and the original airbox design only compounds this. While it&rsquo;s good practice to remove the air filter on a regular basis, and clean it or replace it, for vehicles doing a lot of work offroad, the filter will not last the service interval. Essentially an&nbsp;airbox filter insert upgrade, the simple innovation holds the airbox structure, greatly reducing the risk of engine damage from dust particles. Sold in kits, which also include the corresponding Terrain Tamer Air Filter, as well as sealant required, making it a quick, simple and whole solution for workshops or home mechanics to fit without needing to source anything extra.

TRAINING ENSEMBLE COVERALL SFI>NG

The SFI&rsaquo;NG Training Ensemble Coverall and Balaclava are the latest member of the SARATOGA&reg; family. The Training ensemble &ndash; in this case a coverall and balaclava - has been carefully designed to mimic the design and physiological conditions which a wearer would experience whilst wearing the Operational ensemble through replicating the same weight, thickness and air permeability as is achieved with the Operational coverall. It is vitally important that training garments feel and are as similar as possible to the operational versions of the garments - thus giving the wearer the confidence needed when wearing the Operational versions - he/she is ready to operate without having to think about the PPE. This training coverall does not have the protective&nbsp;properties of the Operational ensemble, but is&nbsp;produced in the identical design, with the same&nbsp;weight and the same wear properties. The tactical&nbsp;training components provide no chemical protective&nbsp;performance and cannot be used as personal&nbsp;protective equipment in a CBRN incident. The&nbsp;ensemble is offered in a different colour to the&nbsp;Operational version, making it easy to distinguish. &nbsp; DESIGN FEATURES The training components have the same equipment features as the protective components. Separate balaclava offering operational donning flexibility Functional pockets on both upper arms and thighs Waistband adjustable on the outside of the coverall Flexible inner cuffs on sleeves and trouser legs Ergonomically pre-shaped elbows and knees Removable protectors inserted in pockets on knees and elbows Boot/trouser hook for a durable and robust interface between footwear and garment &nbsp;
