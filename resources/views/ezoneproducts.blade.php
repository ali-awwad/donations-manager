<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The TCT Communication Mission Planning System takes the guesswork out of tactical communication deployment and enables the user to plan networks in both time and space.&#38;nbsp;The system can be used stand alone or together with CAPAS&#38;trade; alignment systems for unprecedented speed and ease of deployment. By keeping track of the equipment located with each unit, TCT helps a planner quickly identify possible links based on the available equipment and perform radio propagation analysis based on available terrain data. For non-directional links the system can quickly calculate radio coverage for an arbitrary shaped area, useful for typical VHF Combat Radio Networks. Upon deployment network data can be digitally disseminated to the tactical communication nodes, where the CAPAS&#38;trade; alignment systems accurately direct the antennas for optimal performance &#38;mdash; in a matter of seconds! </p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The VULCANO Guided Ammunition Family&#38;nbsp;was developed under a German-Italian&#38;nbsp;government agreement by cooperation of&#38;nbsp;the companies Diehl Defence and&#38;nbsp;Leonardo Electronics &#38;ndash; Defence Systems.&#60;br&#62;This new guided ammunition family,&#38;nbsp;comprising the 127 mm type for navies as&#38;nbsp;well as the 155 mm variant for army&#38;nbsp;artillery, is bound to revolutionize the&#60;br&#62;artillery&#38;acute;s and navy&#38;acute;s indirect fire.&#38;nbsp;The combination of IMU-GPS navigation&#38;nbsp;with the possibility of Terminal Homing&#38;nbsp;based on Semi-Active Laser (SAL) or&#60;br&#62;Far-Infrared (FarIR) sensors enables the&#38;nbsp;VULCANO ammunition to engage even&#38;nbsp;small stationary and moving targets with&#38;nbsp;direct hits at extended ranges.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: bold;">IRIS-T Infra Red Imaging System &ndash; Tail/Thrust Vector Controlled</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The IRIS-T guided missile was developed as aircraft armament for air combat.
The combination of thrust vector and aerodynamic control provides the missile with extremely high agility. The imaging IR seeker head in conjunction with intelligent image processing is another technological leap. The target can be designated by the airborne radar or via the pilot's helmet sight. The outstanding features of IRIS-T even enable the engagement of targets behind the aircraft as well as interception of enemy missiles.
In addition to the consortium partners Germany (pilot nation), Greece, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Spain, further countries worldwide have decided to procure IRIS-T. It was selected as standard weapon for the Eurofighter, F5, F-16, EF-18, Tornado and Gripen fighter aircraft.
Besides its role as aircraft armament, IRIS-T is now also used as surface-to-air missile, e.g. in the ground-based air defence system IRIS-T SLS for object and short-range protection. Furthermore, the Norwegian Air Force demonstrated for the first time in a firing trial in 2016 that IRIS-T is also able to engage sea targets.
Diehl Defence is prime contractor in the IRIS-T program, producing the missile since 2005 in cooperation with industrial partners from six European program nations.
A performance upgrade of the IRIS-T missile to a block II version is currently being prepared by the IRIS-T consortium under the leadership of Germany.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: bold;">Ziesel</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Ziesel is an unmanned, all-electric tracked infantry support platform. With a weight of approx. 300 kg and the dimensions (L x W x H) 1.3 m x 1.3 m x 0.7&#38;nbsp;m, it achieves a speed of approx. 20 km/h. It overcomes slopes of 60 % with a torque of 1000 Nm. The platform has a range of 40&#38;nbsp;km with one battery charge. The battery (charging capacity = 9.7kWh) can be removed and quickly exchanged.
The Ziesel is to be regarded as a soldier support platform. Accordingly, the focus of the functions is on relieving the soldier. Heavy, health-endangering, exhausting and dangerous activities are to be taken over by the Ziesel. This should enable the soldier to be ready for action for longer and to concentrate more on the prevailing situation. In addition to relieving the soldier, the Ziesel also serves to gather information and can thus additionally support the soldier's safety.
The Ziesel is currently the smallest infantry support platform. Due to its very high payload, which far exceeds its own weight, it can, however, meet all the requirements formulated so far by the armies and is thus in no way inferior to its competitors. The small design makes it manoeuvrable and precisely controllable, which means that the Ziesel follows the soldier without any problems even in very dense vegetation in the forest. Since the width of the platform only slightly exceeds that of the soldier, only a few smaller trees are run over when driving through the forest. This leads to an almost silent following and to a much more difficult reconnaissance by the enemy. Furthermore, this characteristic allows the Ziesel to move much faster in the forest.
Following unmanned capabilities are provided by the integrated PLATON Autonomy Kit from Diehl Defence.
&#38;bull;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; Teleoperation: The operator directly controls the UGV using a joystick. He can control the UGV under LOS and NLOS conditions. Usually a wireless communication is required to send commands to the UGV and to receive status feedback. For NLOS additionally the video-stream of one or more cameras must be streamed via communication network. Both, commands and video must be transmitted with low latency (ideally in real time). Communication range is usually 1-3 km depending on the radios and environment. Under LOS conditions, the UGV may also be controlled using gesture control. In this case, no radio communication is required.
&#38;bull;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; Convoy/Follow Me: &#60;br&#62;For smaller UGVs following a soldier, tracking can be done with cameras only. The following mode does not require active sensors or GNSS. This makes the UGV difficult for the enemy to detect and robust against electronic warfare assets.
&#38;bull;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; MULE/Patrolling: In this mode the UGVs follows a recorded route. The route can be recorded in teleoperation mode or follow me mode. The record consists of GPS data and optionally digital 3D map data derived from LiDAR and Radar data. Live data from LiDAR and Radar enables the UGV to detect and avoid obstacles during the MULE mission.
&#38;bull;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp; Waypoint Navigation: The operator selects one or several waypoints. The mission planning algorithm generates a path based on these waypoints. If available, also street map data can be included in the planning.</p>

Additionally, in self-protection, it is capable of intercepting approaching anti-radar missiles. The high degree of automation enables the system to be operated with minimal manpower and allows rapid tactical deployments with short set-up and dismantling times. &#60;br&#62;The use of standardized interfaces provides the optimum basis for future upgrades or expansions. Whether it is a matter of reconfiguration or modernization of existing air defence systems, Diehl Defence finds suitable solutions for its customers&#38;rsquo; needs. This has already been proven in projects for international customers and in numerous test firings with different radars and command and control systems.
&#38;nbsp;
IRIS-T SLS
&#60;br&#62;Using the IRIS-T air-to-air guided missile in the surface-to-air version represents an effective and cost favourable solution for the implementation of a short and very-short range air defence system. For this purpose, an adapted software is installed automatically on the IRIS-T guided missile when loaded onto the launcher. By this approach, the use of missiles already procured and introduced into service can be significantly expanded. In some Northern European countries, IRIS-T SLS versions for mobile and stationary deployment are already under contract.&#60;br&#62;With an effective range of up to 12 km and a height coverage of 6 km, IRIS-T SLS provides full 360&#38;deg; protection for high-value objects and point defence against a broad threat catalogue. In addition, IRIS-T SLS offers the possibility to combine all components (launcher with effector, sensor and fire control station C2) of an air defence system on only one protected carrier vehicle. This results in the third version generation of the proven system: IRIS-T SLS Mk. III. With its high basic mobility and fire-on-the-move capability, IRIS-T SLS Mk. III is capable of protecting forces on the move against all airborne threats within the shortest possible reaction times.
&#38;nbsp;
IRIS-T SLX
&#60;br&#62;Diehl Defence is tasked to develop and field its new IRIS-T SLX long-range air defence system. It brings along the most modern technology and maximum protection. With its new dual mode seeker, among others, this system provides superior protection within 80 km effective range and 30 km altitude coverage. IRIS-T SLM and IRIS-T SLX can be combined on the same launcher in the same system configuration. As well as for Diehl Defence&#38;rsquo;s other GBAD system, C2 and sensor for the long-range system can be chosen by the customers tailored to their mission and requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">BANS&#38;trade; introduces effective anti-aircraft defence without a single shot fired. The light shoulder weapon simulates a missile launch pattern that digitally stimulates an aircraft&#38;rsquo;s missile launch warning and detection system and triggers its alarm. The combat aircraft or helicopter is forced to immediately dispense countermeasures with flares. Extensive use of flares leaves the combat aircraft vulnerable to anti-aircraft missiles. Pilots must then either abort their mission or remain under VSHORAD missiles.
A New Course of Future Airstrike Missions
BANS&#38;trade; redefines the modern approach to air defence with a new philosophy and design. The BANS&#38;trade; device is battery-powered and delivers up to 500 simulated missile launch activations. It is easy to use, with no specific training needed and very cost-effective. As such, BANS&#38;trade; devices can be widely distributed throughout the battlefield with a swarm attack logic, thus significantly shifting the course of future airstrike missions.&#38;nbsp;
Contemporary Philosophy of Air Defence
BANS&#38;trade; has multiple usage varieties, but the most effective is when used in tandem with MANPADS, SHORAD or mounted on any remote weapon station or drone. This results in a significant increase in target hit probability. BANS&#38;trade; presents the revolution of VSHORAD tactical warfare.&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;</p>

Many of the world's premier aircraft in service today are still outfitted with traditional analog HUDs using obsolete, high maintenance cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. But BAE Systems'&#38;nbsp;Digital Light Engine (DLE) HUD is a modular upgrade that replaces out-of-date HUDs with an electro-optic digital display that increases the HUD's reliability 10 fold &#38;mdash; the best upgrade product on the market.
Our DLE integrates into existing aircraft systems seamlessly and quickly, avoiding costly cabling and computer changes, as well as downtime. And for aircraft being upgraded to digital systems, DLE is an opportunity to simplify aircraft architecture by removing legacy analog drive systems.
Benefits of our DLE Head-Up Display (HUDs) include:

Significant reduction of lifecycle costs, with up to 10 times the reliability of traditional analog HUDs (increased Mean Time Between Failure)
No obsolescence and maintenance issues due to removal of conventional CRT technology
Provides additional mission capability by supporting increased symbology and video capabilities of the future
Backward compatibility to any existing aircraft interface, with minimal impact on display performance
Faster upgrades &#38;ndash; installation requires no changes to aircraft, cabling, or computing&#38;nbsp;
Consistent luminance throughout life of equipment, with high-resolution symbology viewable under any flight conditions
Daylight video capability and compatibility with in-service night-vision goggles

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Combat-proven for over 5 years, BAE Systems'&#38;nbsp;APKWS&#38;reg; laser-guidance kit redefines precision by hitting targets with pinpoint accuracy and minimal collateral damage &#38;ndash; critical for air-to-ground missions when you only have one shot.
The U.S. Government's only program of record for 2.75-inch laser-guided rockets, our APKWS guidance kit transforms an unguided 2.75-inch (70 millimeter) rocket into a precision-guided rocket that gives rotary- and fixed-wing military aircraft a low-cost surgical strike capability.
Effectively filling the weapons gap
The APKWS&#38;nbsp;bridges the gap between unguided rockets and anti-armor munitions, consistently delivering pinpoint accuracy to soft targets at a low cost, that no other system can match.
Unmatched precision strike capability
There are other precision-guided weapons on the market, but few consistently hit their intended target with pinpoint accuracy, while leaving minimal collateral damage. Our guidance section is designed to lock onto targets from over 3 kilometers away, keeping your aircraft and laser designators at a safe distance from threats.
Innovative by design, the APKWS&#38;nbsp;includes advanced DASALS seeker optics located on all four guidance wings. Once fired, the wings deploy, and the optics lock in, guiding the rocket to the target &#38;ndash; delivering accuracy when it matters most.

Wing slot seals protect optics from adjacent firings, sand, and moisture prior to launch to ensure no damage or debris inhibit the seeker from locking onto targets
Optics lock onto moving or stationary targets in open or confined areas, supporting a wide variety of missions, and eliminating the possibility of a lost or uncontrolled rocket after launch
40-degree instantaneous field of regard enables a broad capture area for the rocket to adjust mid-flight and stay on track to its target

Proven in combat, preferred worldwide
To date, 17 of the world's most utilized rotary- and fixed-wing launch platforms are qualified with BAE&#38;nbsp;Systems' APKWS&#38;nbsp;laser-guidance kit , including:

There are 17 launch platforms qualified with our APKWS guidance section

In combat, our APKWS&#38;nbsp;system has achieved over a 93 percent hit rate when fired from rotary- and fixed-wing platforms. In fact, it is the most accurate precision guided weapon in its class, exceeding program requirements. That is just part of why the APKWS is utilized by all four branches of the U.S. armed forces, as well as numerous allied countries.

U.S. Army has achieved numerous confirmed successful engagements in support of current combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan
U.S. Air Force has fired hundreds of fixed-wing units in theater to date
U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy have fired thousands of combined fixed- and rotary-wing shots in total, including hundreds in combat scenarios

A flexible, more modular design
Our mid-body guidance and control section is compatible with existing and new inventories of 2.75-inch (70 millimeter) rocket motors, warheads, and launchers. It simply inserts between the rocket motor and warhead for easy installation on a variety of platforms.

Requires no modifications to the standard rocket motor, firing platform or fire control system
Light weight allows pilots to carry more stowed weapons, to engage more targets in combat
Requires minimal training, for a seamless transition from firing Hydra rockets
New design for fixed-wing platforms took just seven months to integrate on the AV-8B Harrier

Cost effective
The APKWS system is the most cost effective laser-guided munition in its class. Instead of buying costly new weapon systems, users simply implement our upgrade into existing unguided rocket inventories for long range precision fires at the industry's lowest total ownership cost.
We maximize these cost savings by integrating our solution on platforms used around the world, such as the AH-64 Apache and F-16 Fighting Falcon, to expand mission flexibility.
Prepared for high demand
Demand from U.S. and international governments for our advanced precision guidance kits is growing, and we are positioned to support this need.

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: bold;">.375 SWISS P</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The new .375 SWISS P long-distance ammunition has been especially developed for the requirements of operational precision shooters. The new calibre is suitable for highly demanding situations and markedly increases the operational spectrum of the proven .338 weapons system. .375 SWISS P&#38;nbsp;calibre projectile types can reach distances of up to 1,600 m supersonic, which equates to an increase in operational range of more than 10 percent when compared to the .338 LM. This helps you to extend the time window for infiltration and exfiltration, and with it, increase your own protection.
The powerful upgrade&#38;nbsp;for your .338 weapon system
Manufacturers of typically robust .338 Lapua Mag. rifles only need to validate their system with the&#38;nbsp;new .375 SWISS P chambered barrel. The new calibre fills the gap between .338 calibre and .50,&#38;nbsp;providing you with a tactical advantage for the most diverse missions.&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62;.375 SWISS P is the optimum upgrade for proven .338 weapon&#38;nbsp;systems. No cumbersome system change is required to benefit&#38;nbsp;from the new calibre. The majority of .338 weapons systems can&#38;nbsp;be upgraded with only modest effort. Manufacturers can officially&#38;nbsp;change the barrel and .375 SWISS P ammunition is fully ready to be&#38;nbsp;deployed on your .338 weapon system. It can also be used with&#38;nbsp;a interchangeable barrel on multi-calibre weapons systems.&#38;nbsp;Negligible weight increase means that operational precision&#38;nbsp;shooters can still benefit from supreme manoeuvrability:&#38;nbsp;a significant advantage over heavy .50 weapons systems.</p>

The notion &#34;high precision reduction gear&#34;&#38;nbsp;designates the full integration of high precision reduction gear and high precision radial-axial bearing in a single unit.&#38;nbsp;TwinSpin&#38;reg;&#38;nbsp;high precision reduction gears are designed for applications requiring a high reduction ratio, high kinematic accuracy, low lost motion, high moment capacity and high stiffness of a compact design with a limited installation zone, and low mass.
This new transmission concept allows the utilization of the reduction gear TwinSpin&#38;reg; in robotics and automation, machine tools, measuring equipments, navigation systems, aircraft industry, military and medicine field, wood-working field, printers branch, machines for textile industry and glass treatment, filling machines, etc. The geargboxes TwinSpin&#38;reg; are modificated to G, T, M, H and E series.


The basic parts of TwinSpin&#38;reg; high precision reduction gear are:&#38;nbsp;

case&#38;nbsp;-&#38;nbsp;incoporates the high capacity, precision radial-axial output bearings integrated in the reduction gear
output sealing&#38;nbsp;- on the output flange side, it prevents internal contamination and lubricant leakage from the reduction gear
flanges&#38;nbsp;- input and output flanges are fixed together by fitted bolts, and rotate at reduced speed in the radial-axial output bearing relative to the case
shaft&#38;nbsp;- high-speed member of the reduction mechanism carried by roller bearings in the flanges. Bearing raceways are ground directly on the shaft and the flangers. The shaft eccentrics rotationally support the trochoidal gears via roller bearings
trochoidal gearing&#38;nbsp;- their trochoidal profile with almost 50% simultaneous meshing ensures transmission of the high torque and backlash-free performance of the reduction gear
transformation member&#38;nbsp;- transforms the planetary motion of the trochoidal gears to the rotary motion of a pair of flanges

&#38;nbsp;
Proven to be significantly more effective than the 40-year old Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV), the Marine Corps approved the&#38;nbsp;Initial Operational Capability&#38;nbsp;of the ACV on November 13, 2020. This declaration came shortly before BAE Systems&#38;rsquo; received a $184 million contract to move into&#38;nbsp;full-rate production&#38;nbsp;on the program. Both milestones validate years of BAE Systems&#38;rsquo; dedication and teamwork in partnership with the U.S. Marines to introduce the ACV capability to the warfighter.

Family of Vehicles




BAE Systems is currently under contract for the development of engineering drawings, manufacture and test support for three ACV command and control mission role variants; and the development of the ACV medium caliber cannon mission role variant. In June 2019, the U.S. Marine Corps awarded BAE Systems a $67 million contract for the work.

The&#38;nbsp;ACV-C&#38;nbsp;will provide multiple workstations for Marines to maintain and manage situational awareness in the battle space.&#38;nbsp;
The&#38;nbsp;ACV-30&#38;nbsp;mounts a stabilized, medium caliber weapon system to provide the lethality and protection the Marines need while leaving ample room for troop capacity and payload. &#38;nbsp;
The&#38;nbsp;ACV-R&#38;nbsp;will provide field maintenance, recovery, and repair capabilities to the Assault Amphibian companies and battalion in support of the Marine division.


Looking Ahead


The ACV represents the optimum balance of sea and land mobility, survivability and future growth potential. The ACV platform was designed to grow and adapt to mission needs, allowing space for new capabilities as technology evolves such as reconnaissance, electronic warfare, anti-air, and UAS systems integration. With its modular design, the ACV is ready to provide Marines the flexibility to address additional mission roles and future technologies.

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Modern ships must be able to operate in different levels of conflict; from peacekeeping operations firing warning shots to law enforcement missions against pirates, smugglers and terrorists. In military combat, the gun is a vital part of a ship&#38;rsquo;s self-defense against hostile surface vessels, attack aircraft, anti-ship missiles and shore targets. In the littoral scenario, the gun must be able to engage threats that are impossible to address with conventional gun systems.&#38;nbsp;&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62;Survivability in such an environment requires an extremely flexible weapon system. The low weight and compact Bofors 40 Mk4 gun system with its high rate of fire and ability to switch between optimized ammunition types &#38;ndash; including the intelligent 40mm&#38;nbsp;3P all-target ammunition&#38;nbsp;&#38;ndash; provides high survivability and tactical freedom at all levels of conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archerfish combats the resistance of Insensitive munition mines to disposal whilst reducing resource outlays. Clearance time is lowered by a factor of 4 units and through life costs are also reduced due to the integration of the warhead and package.&#60;br&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;br&#62;Archerfish can be launched and operated from surface ships, helicopters and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). It is deployed from a launch &#38;lsquo;cradle&#38;rsquo; with a fibre optic data link providing exacting command of the weapon. Through the use of high frequency sonar and low light video data, Archerfish will identify mine threats and then emit a shaped charge warhead, initiating a full order detonation of the target.&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62;Archerfish&#38;rsquo;s credentials are impressive. In service&#38;nbsp;with the United States Navy as part of the MH60s helicopter Airborne Mine Neutralisation System (AMNS),&#38;nbsp;it has been selected as the Common Neutraliser to ultimately equip all United States Navy Mine Countermeasure platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For precision shooting and zeroing, TTS offers marking and scoring technology for supersonic and subsonic projectiles.
The Location of Miss and Hit (LOMAH) Sensor system is infantry precision target system that enables the correct detection of the location of the hit on the target and is even able to detect the exact location of near misses.&#38;nbsp; The calculated position of a shot is transmitted (hardwired or radio) to the range control unit. Due to automatic scoring the system omits the need for repeated access to the target area for the retrieval of information.
Box Target systems operate in subsonic as well as in supersonic regions. They provide trainees and experienced shooters alike with a cost-effective and accurate training system. The high-performance sensing solution, consisting of three sensors mounted inside a wooden framed target, registers the shockwave generated by a projectile.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: bold;">Moving Targets</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shooting on moving targets is a real challenge and provides enhanced situational training for any shooter. Moving target training continues to build the unique awareness and reactionary self-confidence necessary in today&#38;rsquo;s ever changing live-fire environment.
At TTS, the further expansion of modular target systems encompasses the abilities where targetry, silhouettes, motion and speed can be altered to diversify the training and thus enhance training realism. With these capabilities, animation can be as unpredictable as the real combat threat.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: bold;">Stationary Targets</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">TTS offers a wide range of multifunctional infantry target mechanisms for all types of shooting ranges.&#38;nbsp;
The modular concept of our systems enables us to provide deployable, as well as permanently installed, versions of our target lifters supporting flexible applications as radio- or landline controlled, hardwired or battery-powered, solar-powered, or a combination of either or all. These attributes contribute to extraordinary energy efficiency and allows extensive operational cycles without the need of permanent battery charging. Additionally, the compact design and low weight enable convenient transport and easy storage.
TTS supplies professional live fire solutions to train gunners and crews of armored vehicles on intelligent stationary and moving targets. The crews need regular training to improve safe and precise handling of attack and defense weapons under realistic and thus stressful conditions.&#38;nbsp;Advanced Stationary Armor Target (SAT) Mechanisms serve typically on combined arms and multi-purpose ranges and simulate appearing and disappearing full-scale tank targets with dimensions up to 7m x 3m (23 ft x 9.84 ft).&#38;nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During operations or exercises, the troops are often required to be flexible and fast. These requirements should also apply for their accommodation.&#60;br&#62;Our aim is to provide the best possible accommodation for the troops so that they can benefit from relaxing rest phases and thus concentrate fully, both physically and mentally, on their missions. The portable shelter system consists of different modules that cover the areas of accommodation, catering, sanitation and hygiene. Due to the simple and intuitive manageability of the individual modules, the portable shelter system meets the above-mentioned requirements. The set up and dismantling as well as the operation, transport and maintenance of all modules can be carried out without any problems&#60;br&#62;or special tools. All items of equipment function without the use of electricity and can therefore be used completely self-sufficient. They are optimized in&#60;br&#62;terms of weight and volume so that they can be carried in the 110-litre backpacks of the soldiers together with their personal equipment (except&#60;br&#62;for the supplementary accommodation module).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The RFO System is a kit that drops into the pintle of an existing motorized turret, and it provides remote control of both the weapon and the turret. The RFO consists of low-cost, commercial-off-the-shelf components. The RFO weapon system is simple to operate with minimal training, and provides a major tactical advantage by allowing the gunner to deliver suppressive firepower from a protected position.
The RFO System utilizes an intuitive user interface that incorporates a built-in high-definition display. Joystick and trigger controls are straight forward, allowing for quick training and qualification.
Depending on threat/situation, the RFO provides the gunner with the option of manual turret operation, or remote operation. Manual operation provides superior situational awareness, while remote operation provides dramatically improved protection by operating from within the hull of the vehicle. Remote mode also provides improved accuracy and much greater targeting distance due to the RFO&#38;rsquo;s excellent optics and display.
RFO is a modular upgrade to existing ITDS turrets and other platforms. It does not interfere with current armor configurations. Existing fleets can be incrementally upgraded at the Field Depot Level or Theater Storage Area (TSA) in less than one day. The RFO improves lethality while maximizing vehicle mission time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Electronics engineers are very familiar with the need for electromagnetic interference (EMI) protection and will consider in their design good board layout, filtering, grounding, signal integrity etc. to try resolving EMI at its source. However, shielding of the enclosure is just as important and solves the problem of radiated emissions and susceptibility. Shielding is a mechanical fix for an electrical problem and the enclosure design engineer should be aware of the types of gaskets available and their different attributes and ensure there is enough land area on the enclosure seams, doors etc. to fit the gasket.

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The R35010 is a small and lightweight device designed for immediate use.
The R35010 is intended for communication between team members or combat teams in small radio networks. It operates in the frequency band from 2405 MHz to 2480 MHz, and users can communicate using 16 pre-sets (every pre-set defines channel and other settings). The R35010 operates in a Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) system with pulse reception and transmission. Impulse works allows to radically minimize the risk of enemy transmission detection.
The types of communication available on the R35010 radio:&#60;br&#62;&#38;ndash; simplex digital voice communication with the initialization of transmission by built-in PTT button, wireless PTT (WPTT)&#60;br&#62;&#38;ndash; simplex digital voice communication with automatic retransmission&#60;br&#62;&#38;ndash; full duplex digital voice communication (conference mode) with the initialization of transmission by built-in PTT button, wireless PTT (WPTT) with the possibility of simultaneous data transmission (up to 19,2 kb/s); all radios from the network are able to receive conference call simultaneously but the simultaneous transmission is available for up to 4 radios&#60;br&#62;&#38;ndash; max data transmission mode 125 kb/s
Retransmission&#60;br&#62;Unique in personal radios, and at the same time very useful function is the possibility of automatic retransmission. Working with retransmission dramatically increases the range of communication. It provides better &#38;ldquo;coverage&#38;rdquo; of the area, bypassing the various obstacles in the urbanized area or in buildings. It works well in a heavily corrugated area or when there are other obstacles to communication. Only possible in simplex mode.
Initialization of transmission&#60;br&#62;built-in PPT button&#60;br&#62;wireless PTT button (WPTT)&#60;br&#62;double wireless PTT button (DWPTT)&#60;br&#62;by voice (VOX)
Power supply&#60;br&#62;The radio is powered by two AA size batteries, but you can also use ordinary alkaline batteries. They enable the radio to operate for up to 17 hours (transmit: receive: listen: = 1: 7: 16) &#38;ndash; depending on the type of operation and the radio.
Voice information&#60;br&#62;A very convenient and useful feature is to provide voice information of the selected network number. These messages are delivered to the headset loudspeaker if it is connected to the radio or via the internal loudspeaker for manual operation. This function is activated during radio configuration.
Quick programming &#38;ndash; Fill Gun&#60;br&#62;The Fill Gun programmer is used to quickly copy the parameters of every radio pre-sets.
Mobile version&#60;br&#62;The vehicle adapter allows you to mount the radio in the vehicle and connect it to the intercom (on-board internal communication network). Connecting to a mobile antenna increases the range of communication. Good sound quality can be ensured by connecting adapter to an external handset. After mounting of the radio in the vehicle, it is powered from the on-board network.
Group function and integration&#60;br&#62;Activating the grouping feature gives you the opportunity to create radio networks of various structures that selectively transmit or receive correspondence. This feature requires the use of a dual wireless DWPTT transmitter. You can create this way e.g. hierarchical networks mapping the command vertical structure in the service, as well as networks integrated with the high-level radio networks.
Emergency erasing
The user can quickly erase all the settings of the radio. After that normal operation in the transmission and reception mode is not possible. The restoration of normal operation is possible only by re-configuring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">MM-Imager is a Terahertz camera that can detect in real-time all kind of objects hidden on people.
This performant and unique system is a passive solution that emits no radiation and is therefore completely harmless to its users. The camera works in real-time and can work up to several meters away unlike competing products.
It can detect either liquids or solid objects (firearms, explosives, ceramics etc.) while protecting user privacy thanks to an algorithm that automatically detects suspicious objects.
Multiple cameras can work together without interfering. This system is particularly suitable for all applications where the flow of people is important, as the surroundings of major events, protection of sensitive infrastructures or even airports or railway stations.&#38;nbsp;
Cameras can also be integrated to an intelligent mobile building called SACOP, fast and easily deployable.&#38;nbsp;
Finally, MM-Imager is part of the labelled solutions for the security of Paris 2024 Olympics and Paralympics Games.&#38;nbsp;

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The UAV detection and countermeasure integrated system adopts Cognitive Radio Protocol Cracking (CRPC) technology to solve the detection, identification, direction finding, and orientation of civilian UAVs. It also uses wideband interference and GPS spoofing interference technology to combat the UAV implements a lowaltitude security system for driving away control. The system can conduct 360degree passive detection and defense of UAVs in the protected area.
The cognitive radio protocol cracking technology is the fourthgeneration UAV defense method. This technology uses an antenna array to monitor the radio environment in the defense area, and continuously collects radio signals in the defense area for 24 hours. The signal is transmitted to the signal processing unit to accurately demodulate and decode the UAV signal, and then the analyzed UAV signal is transmitted to the data server through the network, and the data server performs unified management of the received UAV signal to UAVs flying illegally and privately carry out interference countermeasures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When it comes to fragmentation test, it is impossible to use a classic 3D configuration for measuring the spatial repartition of fragments due to the high num-ber of pieces which can mask each other.
TrackEye Arena offers an alternative solution where one or several screens with possibly different thick-nesses or materials are positioned at a certain distance from an exploding device and monitored by a high speed camera.
The TrackEye software offers then a combination of dedicated statistics modules to characterize the flying particles impacting the screens for a qualitative un-derstanding of the fragmentation test. The 3D loca-tion, angular dispersion, time of first appearance, and shape of each of the panel holes is detected automati-cally by the TrackEye Arena algorithms. All results are presented in various diagrams including a 3D recon-struction of the fragmentation test even when using one camera only.
The TrackEye ARENA solution is a world standard for fragmentation tests and is being widely used by defence research laboratories and proving grounds throughout the world.</p>

At Terma, we have delivered and installed numerous radar sensor systems worldwide since the early 1990s - initially tailored for VTS applications in ports and waterways where the increased vessel traffic in congested areas called for improved monitoring and surveillance - essentially for economic and safety reasons. Later, port authorities have been forced to tighten up surveillance requirements to encompass security.





Similarly, state sovereignty, EEZ surveillance, preventing illegal migratory and drug trafficking, etc. are nowadays important issues in many countries. The requirements for capable and reliable sensor systems have increased correspondingly, and so far, we have been able to follow this trend in developing radar sensor systems tailored for these exact purposes.

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The M249 light machine gun (LMG), previously&#38;nbsp;designated the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW),&#38;nbsp;and formally written as Light Machine Gun, 5.56 mm, is an American version of the Belgian FN Minimi. The M249 is manufactured in the United States and is widely used by the U.S. Armed Forces.&#38;nbsp;The US Ordnance M249 machine gun provides infantry squads with the heavy volume of fire of a machine gun combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle. It can be fed from both linked ammunition and STANAG magazines, like those used in the M16 and M4. This allows the SAW gunner to use rifleman&#38;rsquo;s magazines as an emergency source of ammunition in the event that he runs out of linked rounds.&#38;nbsp;The M249 is gas operated and air cooled. It has a&#38;nbsp;quick-change barrel, allowing the gunner to rapidly&#38;nbsp;replace an overheated or jammed barrel. A folding bipod is attached near the front of the gun and a M1913 rail on the top cover for mounting day &#38;amp; night optic sights.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: bold;">U.S. Ordnance MK19 Mod3</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">US Ordnance produces the MK19 MOD 3 40mm grenade machine gun which is air cooled, blow back operated, automatic fire, belt-fed weapon that has an angle of fire between 70 degrees elevation and 70 degrees depression. The MK19 MOD 3 is not designed to cook off because it fires from an open bolt and has a low barrel temperature during rapid fire. It is capable of firing various rounds, such as the M430A1 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) grenades 40mm grenades, at a cyclic rate of 325 to 375 rounds per minute.
The MK19 MOD 3 can dominate space at short and long range distances with continuous firepower. When employed on the battlefield, it is capable of delivering lethal fire against a variety of targets, including lightly armored vehicles and dismounted infantry out in the open, in defilade, or in entrenched fighting positions. Due to its low recoil and comparatively light weight, the MK19 MOD 3 has been adapted for use on many different platforms, including small attack boats and fast attack vehicles, such as the Humvee (HMMWV), AAV and Stryker, military jeeps and a large variety of naval mounts.
HEDP grenades will penetrate 75mm rolled homogenous armor at a maximum range of 2,212 meters which means it can penetrate most infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers. Dismounted personnel within a radius of 15 meters from impact will be immobilized by blast and fragmentation. The MK19 MOD 3 is especially effective when used against enemy infantry formations.
Since it is highly portable within small and large units, the weapon&#38;rsquo;s high lethality and broad versatility make it the prime choice of U.S. warfighters as an essential weapon in both offensive and defensive operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The U.S. Ordnance M2A2 machine gun is an air-cooled, belt-fed machine gun that fires from a closed bolt and operates on the short recoil principle with fixed headspace and timing. It is capable of both sustained automatic and accurate single-shot fire. It can be mounted on a vehicle, boat, helicopter or other aircraft. Ammunition may be fed from either the left or right side of the gun, making it suitable for use by both infantry and in armored vehicles.
The M2A2 weapon system has been tested to well over 50,000 rounds. Its single-breech lock system allows for field rebuild, eliminating the need for depot-level maintenance during its lifetime and thereby greatly reducing logistical support.
U.S. Ordnance developed its M2A2 12.7mm weapon after years of experience manufacturing machine guns for the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Foreign Allies. Its M2A2 offers the proven performance of the existing M2HB machine gun but also features fixed headspace and timing. This upgrade improves the performance of the battle-proven M2HB weapon system, largely increases the safety level for operating personnel and affords barrel changing on crew-served or coaxial-mounted weapons in 10 or fewer seconds. Only one person needs to change the M2A2 barrel, thereby reducing exposure to enemy fire and quickly readying the weapon for continued operation.
The U.S. Ordnance M2A2 system utilizes the standard barrel thread, which means standard M2HB barrels can be used in the A2 gun as needed, in emergencies or training. (Using the standard M2HB barrel in a QCB weapon requires removing the Barrel Support Locating Pin, then headspacing the barrel using the standard headspace and timing gage.)
Using only the A2 conversion kit, an armorer at the customer location can convert an M2HB machine gun into a U.S. Ordnance M2A2 weapon system in fewer than 30 minutes, without complex tools or machines. Learn more here: http://www.usord.com/weapons/m2a2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Proengin's S4PF solution coupled with existing AP4C technology, is the only available solution on the market with the unique ability to detect threats in both powder and liquid form.&#38;nbsp;
In the recent decades, the nature of threats has evolved (eg Novichocks, opiods, crisis). In the case of chemical warfare agents, many different types are not in the gaseous state at ambient temperatures (20&#38;deg;c, I atm). This is particularly the case for 4th generation CWAs, making it a challenge for detection technologies.&#38;nbsp;
The S4PF scraper collects substances by friction from the polluted surface. After inserting the S4PF into the sampling pipe of the AP4C, the scrapers quickly warms up to evaporate the collected substances. The AP4C will then detect the presence of the threat in the vapours generated.&#38;nbsp;</p>

It&#38;nbsp;is highly competitive with most popular models of non-linear junction detectors. It can operate in continuous and pulse mode as well, having a variable power output. Automatic frequency selection allows operation in complex electromagnetic environment.
The detector generates&#38;nbsp;a response at the 2nd and 3rd harmonics when radiated by an RF probing&#38;nbsp;signal. Semiconductor components of artificial origin will display&#38;nbsp;a higher level&#38;nbsp;on the&#38;nbsp;second&#38;nbsp;harmonic while corrosive semiconductor components of artificial&#38;nbsp;origin&#38;nbsp;will&#38;nbsp;have a higher level on the third harmonic&#38;nbsp;respectively. An&#38;nbsp;&#38;ldquo;HW-24&#38;rdquo;&#38;nbsp;analyzes the 2nd and 3rd&#38;nbsp;harmonics response of the radiated objects, which enables a quick and reliable identification&#38;nbsp;of electronic devices and corrosive&#38;nbsp;semiconductors.
The &#38;ldquo;HW-24&#38;rdquo; automatically finds the best receiving frequency channel&#38;nbsp;free of noise and distortion providing flawless operation even in the&#38;nbsp;complicated&#38;nbsp;electromagnetic environment.
Its power output is harmless to operator&#38;rsquo;s health. Operation at higher frequencies makes it in some cases more efficient than detectors with standard frequencies but with greater power output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Marine Assault Vehicle (MAV)is the latest technology amphibious vehicle designed by FNSS to meet amphibious operational requirements.
During the beach landing phase of an amphibious operation, these vehicles are launched from landing helicopter&#60;br&#62;docks (LHD) and are able to rapidly cover the distance between the vessel and the shore, allowing marine units to land under armour protection. Once on land, they are able to operate alongside other armoured vehicles. The MAV fire power&#60;br&#62;is provided by the purposely designed CAKA dual remote-controlled turret that can be armed with a 12.7 mm MG and a 40 mm AGL. Designed to support dual operations based on their mission requirements, armoured amphibious assault vehicles need to ensure superior capabilities both at sea and on land. A unique hull design and powerful water jets make the MAV highly mobile in the water with a speed of 7 knots, as well as on land, at 70 km/h maximum speed.
The base vehicle can be configured in different variants such as Personnel Carrier and Command Post. Few navies worldwide possess such a capability.
The FNSS MAV carries the armour protected amphibious fighting vehicle concept into the 21st century. Compared to similar systems, the MAV can be considered superior in the following respects:
&#38;bull; Number of transported personnel,&#60;br&#62;&#38;bull; Level of ballistic and mine protection,&#60;br&#62;&#38;bull; New generation remote controlled turret,&#60;br&#62;&#38;bull; Performances on land and afloat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The PARS IV 6x6 Special Operation&#38;rsquo;s (S-Ops) Vehicle is designed to meet the tactical and operational requirements of military and internal security forces whose mission is &#38;laquo;special&#38;raquo;.
It is able to operate in a wide range of terrains, climate types and is optimized for different operational requirements. It is highly versatile, reflecting the broad spectrum of potential missions and areas of&#60;br&#62;operation.
The PARS IV 6x6 S-Ops Vehicle operates in all weather and all terrain conditions, day and night, including cross-country&#60;br&#62;and urban areas. The vehicle has been specifically designed to carry special operations units to their mission objectives where multiple threats can be in place and provide fire support to the special operation teams in the field.
All team members enjoy a high level of electro-optic situational awareness. The vehicle special design provides the driver and personnel located in the front section of the vehicle with maximum direct view situational awareness, of over 180&#38;deg;.
The new generation electronic infrastructure provides 360&#38;deg; situational awareness for all team members. Owing to these features, the vehicle can easily be operated under armour at all times keeping hatches closed.
The vehicle&#38;rsquo;s weapon system is designed to engage multiple targets simultaneously from all directions including high grounds. Two remote controlled turrets are located at the front and rear of the vehicle.
The turrets are fitted with a universal weapon mount which enables them to carry 7.62 mm, or 12.7 mm machine guns, or 40 mm automatic grenade launchers, which can be easily changed depending on mission requirements. Two-axis stabilisation allows firing on the move and the high maximum elevation of the guns enables to engage targets on high grounds (building tops, cliffs etc) and/or low altitude aerial targets.
The PARS IV 6x6 S-Ops Vehicle provides an unmatched optimum combination of the survivability of an MRAP and the tactical mobility of a wheeled armoured combat vehicle. The vehicle&#38;rsquo;s high level of ballistic, mine and IED protection along with the RPG net is designed to protect the crew and the powerpack against unconventional threats where the timing and intensity of the threat cannot be estimated. The high performance powerpack and ride-height adjustable independent, hydropneumatic suspension system provide unmatched tactical mobility to overcome difficult terrain and road conditions, as well as drive safety and comfort for the crew.
Front and rear axle steering provides a turning radius narrower than a 4x4 vehicle. This unique feature enables rapid manoeuvre capability in narrow spaces, especially in low infrastructure urban areas.

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Flashlube Catch Can Pro is a premium oil fume filter that protects the engine by filtering out damaging oil mist and condensation from the air entering the inlet passage. This oil mist and condensation often causes carbon build up resulting in loss of power, fuel economy and can consequently lead to expensive engine damage.

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Common Rail Diesel Systems can be incredibly efficient, however they are also intolerant to water and dirt particles that can result in costly engine repair. To help protect your engine from this damage, fit a Flashlube Diesel Filter. To ensure such a high pressured fuel system is kept clean &#38;amp; lubricated, always use with Flashlube Common Rail Diesel Conditioner.
The Flashlube Diesel Filter is a modular diesel fuel filter/water separator system. It features a complete range of modules and components to meet any diesel filtration need. Attached to a header is a 30 Micron Pre-Filter/Water Separator Element, which contains the media to remove water &#38;amp; other contaminants.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: bold;">Air filter insert</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The upper filter housing of some 4WDs features a seal surface too narrow to match the seal of the filter itself. As a result, the filter is not able to be fully effective, allowing dust to pass through the airbox and enter the engine intake, causing havoc with components.
In response, Terrain Tamer designed a range of vehicle specific,&#38;nbsp;stainless-steel filter inserts&#38;nbsp;for the most problematic vehicle models, which, when fitted, create a surface area that perfectly matches the filter, aligning in the correct position to properly seal, and reducing the issue of dusting.

This problem is particularly prevalent in 4WD&#38;rsquo;s where gravel roads, bull dust and sand all contain damaging particles, and the original airbox design only compounds this.
While it&#38;rsquo;s good practice to remove the air filter on a regular basis, and clean it or replace it, for vehicles doing a lot of work offroad, the filter will not last the service interval.
Essentially an&#38;nbsp;airbox filter insert upgrade, the simple innovation holds the airbox structure, greatly reducing the risk of engine damage from dust particles.
Sold in kits, which also include the corresponding Terrain Tamer Air Filter, as well as sealant required, making it a quick, simple and whole solution for workshops or home mechanics to fit without needing to source anything extra.

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Terrain Tamer&#38;nbsp;Heavy Duty Radiators&#38;nbsp;come complete with steel mounting brackets and improve on the cooling capacity of their genuine counterpart by 8% with both a closer pitch and higher tube count.

Featuring a fully pressed and fused aluminium tank design, they are believed to be the only radiators currently on the market that are not welded. This offers superior strength in contrast to welded units, which are prone to cracking over time with Heavy Duty use. In effect,&#38;nbsp;Terrain Tamer Heavy Duty radiators&#38;nbsp;are far more durable, and strong enough to perform in harsh outback environments or for tough mining applications.
Additionally, the&#38;nbsp;Heavy Duty Radiators&#38;nbsp;are manufactured with a low level warning plug, allowing them to be fitted with an optional extra in-dash warning indicator device. Once fitted, this unit warns the operator in the event of radiator or hose damage, which may result in coolant stopping activation and can potentially cause extensive and costly damage.

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The extreme hardness of SECURE plates meets maximum safety requirements while minimizing plate thicknesses. These steels are generally supplied in QT (quenched and tempered) condition, and exhibit a fine martensitic structure.
Our SECURE Protection steels include

SECURE 400 &#38;reg;
SECURE 450 &#38;reg;
SECURE 500 &#38;reg;
SECURE 600 &#38;reg;

Among the range of high-strength safety and security steels,&#38;nbsp;SECURE 450&#38;nbsp;is particularly outstanding for its improved toughness and superlative formability. This grade owes these charac-teristics to its fine martensitic-bainitic structure. Consequently, it is particularly suitable to provide protection against explosives, or to satisfy demanding design requirements.
In common with all other grades referred to, this steel is also supplied in QT condition. In order to provide adequate protection against ballistic threats, it is essential that the steel exhibits exceptional hardness. Similarly, the greater the hardness, the better the ballistic protection in general afforded by the steel. Ilsenburger Grobblech GmbH produces these steels in thicknesses from 3 mm to 150 mm. Together with the affiliate Universal Eisen und Stahl, we sell steels for ballistic and mine protection with approval according to TL 2350-0000 for all production systems. We offer stock and fixed formats, cuts, molded parts and ready-to-install constructions
The grades most commonly used to protect against ballistic threats are&#38;nbsp;SECURE 400&#38;nbsp;and&#38;nbsp;SECURE 500. Thanks to their excellent combination of great hardness coupled with superb toughness, these steels meet the requirements contained in the principal national and international specifications.&#38;nbsp;SECURE 600&#38;nbsp;satisfies the highest demands for ballistic protection.

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Field-tested, Lightweight Aluminum Wheels Proven to Perform in the Toughest Environments
Hutchinson provides field-tested aluminum wheel solutions to the most important vehicles in the world. The Hutchinson wheel continues to perform in major military conflicts and is also utilized in many commercial and security vehicle applications.
Vehicle builders have special needs when it comes to adapting their platform to customer demands. Hutchinson can propose a turnkey solution, from concept to production, to accommodate special demand regardless of the potential production quantities.
&#38;nbsp;As your one-stop wheel solution, Hutchinson can:

Develop a concept
Optimize the design
Produce prototypes
Validate and certify the product to any standard requested
Deliver production

OPTIMIZED WEIGHT
Any reduction of wheel weight allows for additional armoring, increased payload, improved fuel mileage, optimized suspension/dynamic behavior or amphibious capability.
Solution:&#38;nbsp;Hutchinson lightweight aluminum wheels can&#38;nbsp;save over 50% of the weight&#38;nbsp;of a comparable steel wheel.
MINE&#38;nbsp;PROTECTION
The first barrier against a mine blast is the wheel assembly. The energy absorption characteristics of a wheel assembly will mitigate the blast.
Solution:&#38;nbsp;Independent testing of the Hutchinson aluminum wheel design has proven&#38;nbsp;to reduce the acceleration from a blast significantly&#38;nbsp;when compared to a comparable steel wheel.
IMPACT&#38;nbsp;RESISTANCE/TOUGHNESS
Military vehicles are often exposed to sizeable impacts while operating off-road or trying to escape danger zones. The wheels are directly affected by these impacts.
Solution: The Hutchinson aluminum wheel has proven to perform in the toughest environments, both off-road and in combat.
FIELD&#38;nbsp;MAINTENANCE &#38;amp; SAFETY
It is impossible to change a tire on a 3-piece lock ring wheel in the field. A tire mounting/dismounting machine or vertical press is needed. A lock ring may open at any time, increasing the risk of injury.
Solution: The 2-piece bolted-together wheels manufactured by Hutchinson can be disassembled and reassembled in the field with standard hand tools.
TACTICAL&#38;trade;&#38;nbsp;TS2 INSTALLATION
Mounting and dismounting the Tire Saver Shield&#38;trade; from a vehicle must be quick and easy. The system can be equipped by the factory or can be mounted later making the Tire Saver Shield&#38;trade; mission-specific.
Solution:&#38;nbsp;The Hutchinson Tire Saver Shield&#38;trade; is easily mounted with screws directly to the wheel without removing the wheel from the vehicle.
INTEGRATED&#38;nbsp;CTIS&#60;br&#62;(CENTRAL TIRE INFLATION SYSTEM)
The traditional CTI valve system plumbing mounted on the face of the wheel is a source of leaks and is difficult to assemble.
Solution:&#38;nbsp;Hutchinson has a patented integrated CTIS wheel design with internal air passages, eliminating external hoses and fittings. This drastically reduces the number of components from up to 30 to as few as 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The SFI&#38;rsaquo;NG Training Ensemble Coverall and Balaclava are the latest member of the SARATOGA&#38;reg; family. The Training ensemble &#38;ndash; in this case a coverall and balaclava - has been carefully designed to mimic the design and physiological conditions which a wearer would experience whilst wearing the Operational ensemble through replicating the same weight, thickness and air permeability as is achieved with the Operational coverall. It is vitally important that training garments &#34;feel&#34; and are as similar as possible to the operational versions of the garments - thus giving the wearer the confidence needed when wearing the Operational versions - he/she is ready to operate without having to think about the PPE.
This training coverall does not have the protective&#38;nbsp;properties of the Operational ensemble, but is&#38;nbsp;produced in the identical design, with the same&#38;nbsp;weight and the same wear properties. The tactical&#38;nbsp;training components provide no chemical protective&#38;nbsp;performance and cannot be used as personal&#38;nbsp;protective equipment in a CBRN incident. The&#38;nbsp;ensemble is offered in a different colour to the&#38;nbsp;Operational version, making it easy to distinguish.
&#38;nbsp;
DESIGN FEATURES
The training components have the same equipment features as the protective components.
